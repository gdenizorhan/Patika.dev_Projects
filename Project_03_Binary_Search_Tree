  [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2] -> Binary Search Tree
  
  The root is 7
  
  Now, we can centered the 7 on our chart
  
                                         7
                                       
  5 is smaller than 7 so, we need to write 5 to the left of the 7
  
                                         7
                                        /
                                       5
                      
  1 is smaller than 7, and smaller than 5 so, we need to write 1 to the left of 7 and 5
  
                                         7
                                        /
                                       5
                                      /
                                     1
                                     
  8 is bigger than 7 so, we need to write 8 to the right of the 7
  
                                         7
                                        / \
                                       5   8
                                      /
                                     1
       
  3 is smaller than 7 and 5 but it is bigger than 1 so, we need to write 3 to the left of 7 and 5, and to the right of the 1
   
                                         7
                                        / \
                                       5   8

                                       3
                                       
  6 is smaller than 7 but it is bigger than 5 so, we need to write 6 to the left of the 7 and, to the right of the 5
    
                                         7
                                        / \

  0 is smaller than 7,5 and 1 so, we need to write 0 to the left of the 1
        
                                         7
                                        / \

  9 is bigger than 7 and 8 so, we need to write 9 to the right of the 8
  
                                         7
                                        / \

  4 is smaller than 7 and 5 but bigger than 1 and 3 so, we need to write 4 to the left of 7 and 5, and to the right of the 3
          
                                         7

  2 is smaller than 7 and 5, and bigger than 1 but smaller than 3 so, we need to write 2 to the left of 7 and 5, and to the right of the 1, and to the left of the 3
